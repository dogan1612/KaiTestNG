We have Synchronization issues when Selenium and the web page are not working parallel with each other.
	>>  “Element Not Found” error  	(such as NoSuchElementException)

Unconditional Synchronization
	>>  Thread.sleep(milliseconds)
    >>  Without check for a condition, Selenium will wait certain time before proceeding.
    >>  Disadvantage is: The tool will be made to wait unnecessarily even when the application is ready.

Conditional Synchronization
    >>  It means, to specify a condition along with the timeout value
    >>  Implicit Wait vs Explicit Wait


When we face an issue:
1-	Check if element is dynamic or not
2-	Check if the element is on same page   -->   check <iframe> tag
3-	If element is not dynamic  & if the element is on the same page, then it is a syncronization issue


IMPLICIT WAIT
Specifies the amount of time the driver should wait when searching for an element if it is not immediately present.
Once set, the implicit wait is set for the life of the WebDriver object instance.
The default setting is 0.

driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(20, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

EXPLICIT WAIT
Specifies to wait for a certain condition to occur before proceeding further in the code.
WebDriverWait by default calls the ExpectedCondition every 500 milliseconds until it returns successfully.

WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 40);         => used for a specific element
wait.until(ExpectedConditions.presenceOfElementLocated(By.xpath(“..”))

We are using explicit wait, (mostly if we have something apart from presence issue)
for a particular element or a condition


FLUENT WAIT
Fluent wait is an implementation of Wait Interface
The fluent wait is used to tell the web driver to wait for a condition, as well as the frequency
with which we want to check the condition before throwing an "ElementNotVisibleException" exception.

Wait<WebDriver> wait = new FluentWait<>(driver)
    .withTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(30))          // sets how long to wait
    .pollingEvery(Duration.ofSeconds(5))          // will check the condition every 5 seconds
    .ignoring(NoSuchElementException.class);

In Selenium3 => You can write .withTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
